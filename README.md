# Automatic Clothing Image Labeling Project

This project aims to automate the labeling of clothing images using artificial intelligence techniques. Two main algorithms are implemented: K-Means and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to identify predominant colors and classify the type of garment in the images.

## Description

The system uses K-Means for unsupervised clustering of pixels and color detection, while KNN is employed for supervised classification of garment types. Together, these algorithms enable automatic labeling of images with color and garment type tags.

### Implemented Improvements

- Use of K-Means++ for centroid initialization, improving accuracy and convergence time.
- Qualitative and quantitative analysis methods to evaluate the performance of the algorithms.

## Results

Accuracy rates of up to 96% were achieved for color classification and 91% for garment type classification. However, challenges were observed in images with complex backgrounds or colors similar to skin tones.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrated the effectiveness of AI techniques for automatic image labeling, although there is room for improvement in classification under complex scenarios.
